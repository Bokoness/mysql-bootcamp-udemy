DELETE FROM cats WHERE name='egg';
    - delete all cats with name egg;

Tip - try to select the data you want before deleting it.
    - for example:
        SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
        - the result should be the data to delete
        - then:
        DELETE FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';


DELETE FROM cats;
    - will delete all cats in the table;
    - equals to SELECT * FROM cats;
    - thats why we should specify WHERE clause all the time
